🧠 NDPA AI Agent — Nigeria Data Protection Assistant
📘 Description

The NDPA AI Agent is an intelligent assistant built to understand, query, and explain the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA).
It allows users to ask natural-language questions — like “What are the rights of data subjects?” or “What are the powers of the Commission?” — and get accurate, well-referenced answers directly from the Act.

The agent leverages the Mastra AI framework with structured JSON knowledge extracted from the NDPA, making it ideal for legal awareness, compliance guidance, and educational purposes.

📄 Features

⚙️ Context-Aware Legal Querying – Understands specific parts, sections, and provisions of the NDPA.

📑 Structured JSON Knowledge Base – Uses a well-organized ndpa-structured.json file for precise retrieval.

🗣️ Conversational Responses – Answers in clear, human-friendly explanations.

🔍 Section Reference Support – Can locate, summarize, or quote any section of the Act.

🤝 Integration-Ready – Can be connected to Telex (A2A protocol) or embedded in websites, chatbots, or compliance tools.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Install dependencies
npm install

2. Set environment variables

You’ll need an AI provider key supported by Mastra AI, such as Groq, Moonshot, or OpenAI.
Example:

export MASTRA_API_KEY="your-key-here"

3. Run the agent locally
npm run dev

4. Query the agent

Once running, you can chat with the NDPA Agent through your preferred interface:

> What is the objective of the NDPA?
> What does Section 4 establish?
> Who appoints the National Commissioner?

⚙️ Configuration Notes

The agent uses a retrieval-based context loader built around ndpa-structured.json.

For best results, ensure your JSON is:

Properly structured with "part_number", "section_number", "title", and "content".

Numbered sequentially (no missing sections).

You can modify the JSON to include related laws or NDPR references later.

📚 Example Query Flow

User: What are the objectives of the Act?
NDPA Agent:
The NDPA’s objectives, found in Part I, Section 1, include safeguarding data subjects’ rights, ensuring lawful processing, and promoting a secure and trusted digital economy.

💡 Future Extensions

Add a compliance checklist generator.

Integrate document upload & analysis (e.g., checking if a company privacy policy aligns with NDPA).

Connect to Telex via A2A protocol for workspace-based interactions.
